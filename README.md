# chrisyarie.com - frontend
## Contains all the frontend code for chrisyarie.com

## Description:
The above really covers it. This is the repo for handling all the frontend concerns for my personal website.

## Deployment:
Coming later.

## Developers:
Index is simple -- background image is loaded via CSS, and I use linear-gradient to tint it. Then use transform
to push the text down, and some media queries to get the thing to render right across devices.

Resume is a work-in-progress, being built using React.
